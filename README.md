# CSC8404 Coursework Solution
This is my solution to the coursework of CSC8404 module that I opted to study at Newcastle University as the MSc Advanced Computer Science student Academic Year 2022-2023. Although, I submitted this solution a year ago from the date of creation of this repository, it is my effort to continuously improve my past work to get better at Java design principles.

The purpose of making this repository public is to get valuable feedback from experienced Java developers who understand the best Java design principles (especially recommended in Effective Java 
by Joshua Bloch) for creating APIs. 

I declare that the solution is my own original work is not copied from anyone else. The existing students of Newcastle University are strongly warned not to copy from my work as you will be charged guilty of plagiarism by the university.
